## 1. Histogram Equalization

Aim to improve the quality of the image sequence provided as most of the Computer Vision pipelines for lane detection or other self-driving tasks require good lighting conditions and color information for detecting good features.

## 2. Lane Detection

In this problem we aim to do simple Lane Detection to mimic Lane Departure Warning systems used in Self Driving Cars.

## 3. Predict Turn

In this problem, we aim to detect the curved lanes and predict the turn depending on the
curvature: either left or right turn.

## Dependencies

Python 3.7 or later

Numpy      (For numerical computation)

Math       (For Mathematical Operations)

OpenCV     (For Visualization and visual computation)

## Steps for Execution
1. Unzip the folder. 
2. Update the path for reference video and final video (if required).
3. Go to the folder location in the terminal.
4. Run the python file with the following command :

Example: -------------------------------------------

python "filename".py 

For the following files for each section:

histogramCode.py

detectLane.py

turnPredict.py

5. Next check output in the corresponding Output folder.
